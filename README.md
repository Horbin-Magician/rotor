# Introduce

Rotor is a "**fast**", "**low occupancy**" and **free** **tools box** running in windows. (Double quotes because it is far from the goal)

Now, Rotor include an Everything-like **global file search** module, a **screenshot** module. 

Admittedly, there are already many similar products, and most of them do better, but they still have some problems.

I think an open source software to bring these small tools together is very necessary.

## File Searching

1. TODO The shortcut key to show the search window is Shift+F, which is not yet customizable.
2. TODO Next, enter any information in the search window to get the search results immediately.
3. TODO Up and down keys to select the result, enter key to open the file. 
4. TODO Right-clicking the result item will open a right-click menu, which currently only provides the function of opening the directory where the file is located.

## Screenshot

1. TODO The shortcut key to printscreen is Shift+C, which is not yet customizable.
2. TODO By default, the captured image is fixed to the screen, and right-clicking the image will open a right-click menu.
