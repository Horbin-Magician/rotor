# Introduce

Rotor is a "**fast**", "**low occupancy**" and **free** **tools box** running in windows. (Double quotes because it is far from the goal)

Now, Rotor include an Everything-like **global file search** module, a **screenshot** module. 

Admittedly, there are already many similar products, and most of them do better, but they still have some problems.

I think an open source software to bring these small tools together is very necessary.

## File Searching

1. Shortcut key `Shift+F` shows the search window, it is not yet customizable.
2. Next, enter any information in the search window to get the search results immediately.
3. `Up` and `down` keys to select the result, `Enter` key to open the file. 
4. A menu is displayed when the mouse hovers over the result item. You can opening the directory where the file is located or run as admin.

## Screenshot

1. Shortcut key `Shift+C` prints screen, it is not yet customizable.
2. By default, the captured image is fixed to the screen, and press `ESC` to close it, `s` to save it, `Enter` to copy it, `h` to minimize it.
